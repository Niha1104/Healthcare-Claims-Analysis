# 🏥 Healthcare Claims Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a sample healthcare claims dataset to identify trends in procedure frequency, submitted charges, and payment amounts. The goal is to understand provider behavior and billing patterns using data analytics and visualizations.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Dataset
A custom healthcare claims dataset containing:
- Provider ID
- Procedure codes and descriptions
- Submitted charges
- Payment amounts
- Patient age and gender

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Checked for missing values and data types
- Explored average charges by procedure
- Summarized provider payment trends

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Chart 1: Procedure Frequency** – Which procedures are most common
- **Chart 2: Average Charge per Procedure** – Cost insights across procedures
- **Chart 3: Submitted vs Paid Scatter Plot** – Billing vs reimbursement patterns

## 📌 What I Learned
- Data wrangling and cleaning in Pandas
- Summarizing real-world healthcare data
- Communicating insights visually
